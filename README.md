week 5  jquery game homework assignment


This is the  " Star Wars" Homework using BattleStar Galactica as a theme I chose.

I am using an array of  5 elements [4, 8, 12, 16, 20] for the base attack power of each character. Each new game or reset the array is shuffled. The array elements are assigned to each character. So each game the character attack base may be different.

I am using   jquery .data to store the character health and attack power. Bootstrap for the grid. 
The reset is accomplished using jquery clone. I clone the jumbotron before the game starts. When I reset, I delete the jumbotron and do a AppendTo of the cloned jumbotron. The win/loss score is retained between resets. This assignment deomostrates the maniuplation of the DOM.
